This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
It is an elevator with 10 floors made with REACT JS for the Frontend, Node JS and Express for the Back, and MongoDB(on MLab) to store the movements of the elevator.
Usage:
run
$ npm install
to install dependencies, then
$ npm start
to start both the back-end server and the Front app.
